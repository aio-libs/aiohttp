Python 3.3, ..., 3.4.1 support
==============================

As of aiohttp **v0.18.0** we dropped support for Python 3.3 up to
3.4.1.  The main reason for that is the :meth:`object.__del__` method,
which is fully working since Python 3.4.1 and we need it for proper
resource closing.

The last Python 3.3, 3.4.0 compatible version of aiohttp is
**v0.17.4**.

This should not be an issue for most aiohttp users (for example Ubuntu
14.04.3 LTS provides python upgraded to 3.4.3), however libraries
depending on aiohttp should consider this and either freeze aiohttp
version or drop Python 3.3 support as well.
