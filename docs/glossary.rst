   keep-alive

       A technique for communicating between HTTP client and server
       when connection is not closed after sending response but kept

       establishment for every request.

   resource

      A concept reflects the HTTP **path**, every resource corresponds
      to *URI*.

      May have an unique name.

      Contains :term:`route`\'s for different HTTP methods.

   route

       A part of :term:`resource`, resource's *path* coupled with HTTP method.

   web-handler

       An endpoint that returns HTTP response.

   websocket

       A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a
       single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized
       by the IETF as :rfc:`6455`
