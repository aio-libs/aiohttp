Request life cycle
------------------

A request goes through the following stages and corresponding fallbacks.


Overview
^^^^^^^^

.. blockdiag::
   :desctable:


   blockdiag {
     orientation = portrait;

     start[shape=beginpoint, description="on_request_start"];
     redirect[description="on_request_redirect"];

DNS resolving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. blockdiag::
   :desctable:

   }


TraceConfig
-----------


.. class:: TraceConfig(trace_config_ctx_factory=SimpleNamespace)

   Trace config is the configuration object used to trace requests
   launched by a :class:`ClientSession` object using different events
   related to different parts of the request flow.

   :param trace_config_ctx_factory: factory used to create trace contexts,
      default class used :class:`types.SimpleNamespace`

   .. method:: trace_config_ctx(trace_request_ctx=None)

      :param trace_request_ctx: Will be used to pass as a kw for the
        ``trace_config_ctx_factory``.

      Build a new trace context from the config.

   Every signal handler should have the following signature::

      async def on_signal(session, context, params): ...

   where ``session`` is :class:`ClientSession` instance, ``context`` is an
   object returned by :meth:`trace_config_ctx` call and ``params`` is a
   data class with signal parameters. The type of ``params`` depends on
   subscribed signal and described below.

      when a request starts.

      ``params`` is :class:`aiohttp.TraceRequestStartParams` instance.

      ``params`` is :class:`aiohttp.TraceConnectionQueuedStartParams`
      instance.

   .. attribute:: on_connection_queued_end

      Property that gives access to the signals that will be executed when a

      instance.

   .. attribute:: on_connection_create_start

      instance.

   .. attribute:: on_connection_create_end

      Property that gives access to the signals that will be executed when a

      instance.

   .. attribute:: on_dns_resolvehost_start

      Property that gives access to the signals that will be executed when a
      request starts to resolve the domain related with the request.

      request was able to use a cached DNS resolution for the domain related
      with the request.

   .. attribute:: on_dns_cache_miss

      Property that gives access to the signals that will be executed when a
      request was not able to use a cached DNS resolution for the domain related
