aiohttp
=======

HTTP client/server for :term:`asyncio` (:pep:`3156`).

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/KeepSafe/aiohttp
.. _Freenode: http://freenode.net


Features
--------

- Supports both :ref:`aiohttp-client` and :ref:`HTTP Server <aiohttp-web>`.
- Supports both :ref:`Server WebSockets <aiohttp-web-websockets>` and
  :ref:`Client WebSockets <aiohttp-client-websockets>` out-of-the-box.
- Web-server has :ref:`aiohttp-web-middlewares`,
  :ref:`aiohttp-web-signals` and pluggable routing.

Library Installation
--------------------

::

   $ pip install aiohttp

You may want to install *optional* :term:`cchardet` library as faster
replacement for :term:`chardet`::

   $ pip install cchardet

Getting Started
---------------

Client example::

    import asyncio
    import aiohttp

    async def fetch_page(session, url):
        with aiohttp.Timeout(10):
            async with session.get(url) as response:
                assert response.status == 200
                return await response.read()

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    with aiohttp.ClientSession(loop=loop) as session:
        content = loop.run_until_complete(
            fetch_page(session, 'http://python.org'))
        print(content)

Server example::

    from aiohttp import web

    async def handle(request):
        name = request.match_info.get('name', "Anonymous")
        text = "Hello, " + name
        return web.Response(body=text.encode('utf-8'))

    app = web.Application()
    app.router.add_route('GET', '/{name}', handle)

    web.run_app(app)

.. note::

   Throughout this documentation, examples utilize the `async/await` syntax
   introduced by :pep:`492` that is only valid for Python 3.5+.

   If you are using Python 3.4, please replace ``await`` with
   ``yield from`` and ``async def`` with a ``@coroutine`` decorator.
   For example, this::

       async def coro(...):
           ret = await f()

   should be replaced by::

       @asyncio.coroutine
       def coro(...):
           ret = yield from f()
