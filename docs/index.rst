        response = yield from aiohttp.request('GET', url)
        assert response.status == 200
        return (yield from response.read())

    content = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(
        fetch_page('http://python.org'))
    print(content)

Server example::

    import asyncio
    from aiohttp import web


    @asyncio.coroutine
    def handle(request):
        name = request.match_info.get('name', "Anonymous")
        text = "Hello, " + name
        return web.Response(body=text.encode('utf-8'))


    @asyncio.coroutine
    def init(loop):
        app = web.Application(loop=loop)
        app.router.add_route('GET', '/{name}', handle)

        srv = yield from loop.create_server(app.make_handler(),
                                            '127.0.0.1', 8080)
        print("Server started at http://127.0.0.1:8080")
        return srv

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(init(loop))
    try:
