==================
Welcome to AIOHTTP
==================

Asynchronous HTTP Client/Server for :term:`asyncio` and Python.

Current version is |release|.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp


Key Features
============

- Supports both :ref:`aiohttp-client` and :ref:`HTTP Server <aiohttp-web>`.
- Supports both :ref:`Server WebSockets <aiohttp-web-websockets>` and
  :ref:`Client WebSockets <aiohttp-client-websockets>` out-of-the-box
  without the Callback Hell.
- Web-server has :ref:`aiohttp-web-middlewares`,
  :ref:`aiohttp-web-signals` and plugable routing.

.. _aiohttp-installation:

Library Installation
====================

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install aiohttp

You may want to install *optional* :term:`cchardet` library as faster
replacement for :term:`chardet`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install cchardet

For speeding up DNS resolving by client API you may install
:term:`aiodns` as well.
This option is highly recommended:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install aiodns

Installing speedups altogether
------------------------------

The following will get you ``aiohttp`` along with :term:`chardet`,
:term:`aiodns` and ``Brotli`` in one bundle. No need to type
separate commands anymore!

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install aiohttp[speedups]

Getting Started
===============

Client example
--------------

.. code-block:: python

  import aiohttp
  import asyncio

  async def main():

      async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
          async with session.get('http://python.org') as response:

              print("Status:", response.status)
              print("Content-type:", response.headers['content-type'])

              html = await response.text()
              print("Body:", html[:15], "...")

  loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
  loop.run_until_complete(main())

This prints:

.. code-block:: text

    Status: 200
    Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Body: <!doctype html> ...

Coming from :term:`requests` ? Read :ref:`why we need so many lines <aiohttp-request-lifecycle>`.

Server example:
----------------

.. code-block:: python

    from aiohttp import web

    async def handle(request):
        name = request.match_info.get('name', "Anonymous")
        text = "Hello, " + name
        return web.Response(text=text)

    app = web.Application()
    app.add_routes([web.get('/', handle),
                    web.get('/{name}', handle)])

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        web.run_app(app)

.. _aiohttp-backward-compatibility-policy:

Policy for Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

*aiohttp* keeps backward compatibility.

After deprecating some *Public API* (method, class, function argument,
etc.) the library guarantees the usage of *deprecated API* is still
allowed at least for a year and half after publishing new release with
deprecation.

All deprecations are reflected in documentation and raises
:exc:`DeprecationWarning`.

Sometimes we are forced to break our own rule for the sake of very strong
reason.  Most likely the reason is a critical bug which cannot be
solved without major API change, but we are working hard for keeping
these changes as rare as possible.
