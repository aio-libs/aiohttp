aiohttp
=======

http client/server for asyncio (:pep:`3156`).

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/KeepSafe/aiohttp


Features
--------

- Supports both :ref:`aiohttp-client` and :ref:`aiohttp-web`.
- Supports :ref:`aiohttp-web-websockets` out-of-the-box.
- Web-server has :ref:`aiohttp-web-middlewares` and pluggable routing.

Library Installation
--------------------

::

   pip install aiohttp

For smart detection of *Content-Type* by client API you would like to
install `chardet` also::

   pip install chardet

*Optional*: To improve performances, you can install `Cython`
**before** `aiohttp`::

   pip install cython

Getting Started
---------------

Client example::

    import asyncio
    import aiohttp

    @asyncio.coroutine
    def fetch_page(url):
        response = yield from aiohttp.request('GET', url)
        assert response.status == 200
        return (yield from response.read())

    content = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(
        fetch_page('http://python.org'))
    print(content)

Server example::

    import asyncio
    from aiohttp import web


    @asyncio.coroutine
    def handle(request):
        name = request.match_info.get('name', "Anonymous")
        text = "Hello, " + name
        return web.Response(body=text.encode('utf-8'))


    @asyncio.coroutine
    def init(loop):
        app = web.Application(loop=loop)
        app.router.add_route('GET', '/{name}', handle)

        srv = yield from loop.create_server(app.make_handler(),
                                            '127.0.0.1', 8080)
        print("Server started at http://127.0.0.1:8080")
        return srv

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(init(loop))
    try:
        loop.run_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
