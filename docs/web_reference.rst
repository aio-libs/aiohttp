Request and Base Request
------------------------

The Request object contains all the information about an incoming HTTP request.

:class:`BaseRequest` is used for :ref:`Low-Level
Servers<aiohttp-web-lowlevel>` (which have no applications, routers,
signals and middlewares). :class:`Request` has an :attr:`Request.app`
and :attr:`Request.match_info` attributes.

A :class:`BaseRequest` / :class:`Request` are :obj:`dict` like objects,
allowing them to be used for :ref:`sharing
data<aiohttp-web-data-sharing>` among :ref:`aiohttp-web-middlewares`
and :ref:`aiohttp-web-signals` handlers.

.. class:: BaseRequest

   .. attribute:: version

      *HTTP version* of request, Read-only property.

      Returns :class:`aiohttp.protocol.HttpVersion` instance.

   .. attribute:: method

      *HTTP method*, read-only property.

      The value is upper-cased :class:`str` like ``"GET"``,
      ``"POST"``, ``"PUT"`` etc.

   .. attribute:: url

      A :class:`~yarl.URL` instance with absolute URL to resource
      (*scheme*, *host* and *port* are included).

      .. note::

         In case of malformed request (e.g. without ``"HOST"`` HTTP
         header) the absolute url may be unavailable.

   .. attribute:: rel_url

      A :class:`~yarl.URL` instance with relative URL to resource
      (contains *path*, *query* and *fragment* parts only, *scheme*,
      *host* and *port* are excluded).

      The property is equal to ``.url.relative()`` but is always present.

      .. seealso::

         A note from :attr:`url`.

   .. attribute:: scheme

      A string representing the scheme of the request.

      The scheme is ``'https'`` if transport for request handling is
      *SSL*, ``'http'`` otherwise.

      The value could be overridden by :meth:`~BaseRequest.clone`.

      Read-only :class:`str` property.

      .. versionchanged:: 2.3

         *Forwarded* and *X-Forwarded-Proto* are not used anymore.

         Call ``.clone(scheme=new_scheme)`` for setting up the value
         explicitly.

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-forwarded-support`

   .. attribute:: secure

      Shorthand for ``request.url.scheme == 'https'``

      Read-only :class:`bool` property.

      .. seealso:: :attr:`scheme`

   .. attribute:: forwarded

      A tuple containing all parsed Forwarded header(s).

      Makes an effort to parse Forwarded headers as specified by :rfc:`7239`:

      - It adds one (immutable) dictionary per Forwarded ``field-value``, i.e.
        per proxy. The element corresponds to the data in the Forwarded
        ``field-value`` added by the first proxy encountered by the client.
        Each subsequent item corresponds to those added by later proxies.
      - It checks that every value has valid syntax in general as specified
        in :rfc:`7239#section-4`: either a ``token`` or a ``quoted-string``.
      - It un-escapes ``quoted-pairs``.
      - It does NOT validate 'by' and 'for' contents as specified in
        :rfc:`7239#section-6`.
      - It does NOT validate ``host`` contents (Host ABNF).
      - It does NOT validate ``proto`` contents for valid URI scheme names.

      Returns a tuple containing one or more ``MappingProxy`` objects

      .. seealso:: :attr:`scheme`

      .. seealso:: :attr:`host`

   .. attribute:: host

      Host name of the request, resolved in this order:

      - Overridden value by :meth:`~BaseRequest.clone` call.
      - *Host* HTTP header
      - :func:`socket.getfqdn`

      Read-only :class:`str` property.

      .. versionchanged:: 2.3

         *Forwarded* and *X-Forwarded-Host* are not used anymore.

         Call ``.clone(host=new_host)`` for setting up the value
         explicitly.

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-forwarded-support`

   .. attribute:: remote

      Originating IP address of a client initiated HTTP request.

      The IP is resolved through the following headers, in this order:

      - Overridden value by :meth:`~BaseRequest.clone` call.
      - Peer name of opened socket.

      Read-only :class:`str` property.

      Call ``.clone(remote=new_remote)`` for setting up the value
      explicitly.

      .. versionadded:: 2.3

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-forwarded-support`

   .. attribute:: path_qs

      The URL including PATH_INFO and the query string. e.g.,
      ``/app/blog?id=10``

      Read-only :class:`str` property.

   .. attribute:: path

      The URL including *PATH INFO* without the host or scheme. e.g.,
      ``/app/blog``. The path is URL-decoded. For raw path info see
      :attr:`raw_path`.

      Read-only :class:`str` property.

   .. attribute:: raw_path

      The URL including raw *PATH INFO* without the host or scheme.
      Warning, the path may be URL-encoded and may contain invalid URL
      characters, e.g.
      ``/my%2Fpath%7Cwith%21some%25strange%24characters``.

      For URL-decoded version please take a look on :attr:`path`.

      Read-only :class:`str` property.

   .. attribute:: query

      A multidict with all the variables in the query string.

      Read-only :class:`~multidict.MultiDictProxy` lazy property.

      Read-only :class:`~multidict.CIMultiDictProxy` property.

   .. attribute:: raw_headers

      HTTP headers of response as unconverted bytes, a sequence of
      ``(key, value)`` pairs.

   .. attribute:: keep_alive

      ``True`` if keep-alive connection enabled by HTTP client and
      protocol version supports it, otherwise ``False``.

      Read-only :class:`bool` property.

   .. attribute:: transport

      A :ref:`transport<asyncio-transport>` used to process request.
      Read-only property.

      The property can be used, for example, for getting IP address of
      client's peer::

         peername = request.transport.get_extra_info('peername')
         if peername is not None:
             host, port = peername

   .. attribute:: cookies

      A read-only dictionary-like object containing the request's cookies.

      Read-only :class:`~types.MappingProxyType` property.

   .. attribute:: content

      A :class:`~aiohttp.StreamReader` instance,
      input stream for reading request's *BODY*.

      Read-only property.

   .. attribute:: body_exists

      Return ``True`` if request has *HTTP BODY*, ``False`` otherwise.

      Read-only :class:`bool` property.

      .. versionadded:: 2.3

   .. attribute:: can_read_body

      Return ``True`` if request's *HTTP BODY* can be read, ``False`` otherwise.

      Read-only :class:`bool` property.

      .. versionadded:: 2.3

   .. attribute:: content_type

      Read-only property with *content* part of *Content-Type* header.

      Returns :class:`str` like ``'text/html'``

      .. note::

         Returns value is ``'application/octet-stream'`` if no
         Content-Type header present in HTTP headers according to
         :rfc:`2616`

   .. attribute:: charset

      Read-only property that specifies the *encoding* for the request's BODY.

      The value is parsed from the *Content-Type* HTTP header.

      Returns :class:`str` like ``'utf-8'`` or ``None`` if
      *Content-Type* has no charset information.

   .. attribute:: content_length

      Read-only property that returns length of the request's BODY.

      The value is parsed from the *Content-Length* HTTP header.

      Returns :class:`int` or ``None`` if *Content-Length* is absent.

   .. attribute:: http_range

      Read-only property that returns information about *Range* HTTP header.

      Returns a :class:`slice` where ``.start`` is *left inclusive
      bound*, ``.stop`` is *right exclusive bound* and ``.step`` is
      ``1``.

      The property might be used in two manners:

      1. Attribute-access style (example assumes that both left and
         right borders are set, the real logic for case of open bounds
         is more complex)::

            rng = request.http_range
            with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
                f.seek(rng.start)
                return f.read(rng.stop-rng.start)

      2. Slice-style::

            return buffer[request.http_range]

   .. attribute:: if_modified_since

      Read-only property that returns the date specified in the
      *If-Modified-Since* header.

      Returns :class:`datetime.datetime` or ``None`` if
      *If-Modified-Since* header is absent or is not a valid
      HTTP date.

   .. attribute:: if_unmodified_since

      Read-only property that returns the date specified in the
      *If-Unmodified-Since* header.

      Returns :class:`datetime.datetime` or ``None`` if
      *If-Unmodified-Since* header is absent or is not a valid
      HTTP date.

      .. versionadded:: 3.1

   .. attribute:: if_match

      Read-only property that returns :class:`~aiohttp.ETag` objects specified
      in the *If-Match* header.

      Returns :class:`tuple` of :class:`~aiohttp.ETag` or ``None`` if
      *If-Match* header is absent.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8

   .. attribute:: if_none_match

      Read-only property that returns :class:`~aiohttp.ETag` objects specified
      *If-None-Match* header.

      Read-only property that returns the date specified in the
      *If-Range* header.

      Returns :class:`datetime.datetime` or ``None`` if
      *If-Range* header is absent or is not a valid
      HTTP date.

      .. versionadded:: 3.1

   .. method:: clone(*, method=..., rel_url=..., headers=...)

      Clone itself with replacement some attributes.

      Creates and returns a new instance of Request object. If no parameters
      are given, an exact copy is returned. If a parameter is not passed, it
      will reuse the one from the current request object.

      :param str method: http method

      :param rel_url: url to use, :class:`str` or :class:`~yarl.URL`

      :param headers: :class:`~multidict.CIMultiDict` or compatible
                      headers container.

      :return: a cloned :class:`Request` instance.

   .. method:: get_extra_info(name, default=None)

      Reads extra information from the protocol's transport.
      If no value associated with ``name`` is found, ``default`` is returned.

      :param str name: The key to look up in the transport extra information.

      :param default: Default value to be used when no value for ``name`` is
                      found (default is ``None``).

      .. versionadded:: 3.7

   .. comethod:: read()

      Read request body, returns :class:`bytes` object with body content.

      .. note::

         The method **does** store read data internally, subsequent
         :meth:`~aiohttp.web.BaseRequest.read` call will return the same value.

   .. comethod:: text()

      Read request body, decode it using :attr:`charset` encoding or
      ``UTF-8`` if no encoding was specified in *MIME-type*.

      Returns :class:`str` with body content.

      .. note::

         The method **does** store read data internally, subsequent
         :meth:`~aiohttp.web.BaseRequest.text` call will return the same value.

   .. comethod:: json(*, loads=json.loads, \
                    content_type='application/json')

      Read request body decoded as *json*. If request's content-type does not
      match `content_type` parameter, :exc:`aiohttp.web.HTTPBadRequest` get raised.
      To disable content type check pass ``None`` value.

      :param collections.abc.Callable loads: any :term:`callable` that accepts
                              :class:`str` and returns :class:`dict`
                              with parsed JSON (:func:`json.loads` by
                              default).
      :param str content_type: expected value of Content-Type header or ``None``
                              ('application/json' by default)

      .. note::

         The method **does** store read data internally, subsequent
         :meth:`~aiohttp.web.BaseRequest.json` call will return the same value.


   .. comethod:: multipart()

      Returns :class:`aiohttp.MultipartReader` which processes
      incoming *multipart* request.

      The method is just a boilerplate :ref:`coroutine <coroutine>`
      implemented as::

         async def multipart(self, *, reader=aiohttp.multipart.MultipartReader):
             return reader(self.headers, self._payload)

      This method is a coroutine for consistency with the else reader methods.

      .. warning::

         The method **does not** store read data internally. That means once
         you exhausts multipart reader, you cannot get the request payload one
         more time.

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-multipart`

      .. versionchanged:: 3.4

         Dropped *reader* parameter.

   .. comethod:: post()

      A :ref:`coroutine <coroutine>` that reads POST parameters from
      request body.

      Returns :class:`~multidict.MultiDictProxy` instance filled
      with parsed data.

      If :attr:`method` is not *POST*, *PUT*, *PATCH*, *TRACE* or *DELETE* or
      :attr:`content_type` is not empty or
      *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* or *multipart/form-data*
      returns empty multidict.

      .. note::

         The method **does** store read data internally, subsequent
         :meth:`~aiohttp.web.BaseRequest.post` call will return the same value.

   .. comethod:: release()

      Release request.

      Eat unread part of HTTP BODY if present.

      .. note::

          User code may never call :meth:`~aiohttp.web.BaseRequest.release`, all
          required work will be processed by :mod:`aiohttp.web`
          internal machinery.

   .. comethod:: wait_for_disconnection()

      Returns when the connection that sent this request closes

      If there is no client disconnection during request handling, this
      coroutine gets cancelled automatically at the end of this request being
      handled.

      This can be used in handlers as a means of receiving a notification of
      premature client disconnection.

      .. versionadded:: 4.0

.. class:: Request

   A request used for receiving request's information by *web handler*.

   Every :ref:`handler<aiohttp-web-handler>` accepts a request
   instance as the first positional parameter.

   The class in derived from :class:`BaseRequest`, shares all parent's
   attributes and methods but has a couple of additional properties:

   .. attribute:: match_info

      Read-only property with :class:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo`
      instance for result of route resolving.

      .. note::

         Exact type of property depends on used router.  If
         ``app.router`` is :class:`UrlDispatcher` the property contains
         :class:`UrlMappingMatchInfo` instance.

   .. attribute:: app

      An :class:`Application` instance used to call :ref:`request handler
      <aiohttp-web-handler>`, Read-only property.

   .. attribute:: config_dict

      A :class:`aiohttp.ChainMapProxy` instance for mapping all properties
      from the current application returned by :attr:`app` property
      and all its parents.

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-data-sharing-app-config`

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

   .. note::

      You should never create the :class:`Request` instance manually
      -- :mod:`aiohttp.web` does it for you. But
      :meth:`~BaseRequest.clone` may be used for cloning *modified*
      request copy with changed *path*, *method* etc.




.. _aiohttp-web-response:


Response classes
----------------

For now, :mod:`aiohttp.web` has three classes for the *HTTP response*:
:class:`StreamResponse`, :class:`Response` and :class:`FileResponse`.

Usually you need to use the second one. :class:`StreamResponse` is
intended for streaming data, while :class:`Response` contains *HTTP
BODY* as an attribute and sends own content as single piece with the
correct *Content-Length HTTP header*.

For sake of design decisions :class:`Response` is derived from
:class:`StreamResponse` parent class.

The response supports *keep-alive* handling out-of-the-box if
*request* supports it.

You can disable *keep-alive* by :meth:`~StreamResponse.force_close` though.

The common case for sending an answer from
:ref:`web-handler<aiohttp-web-handler>` is returning a
:class:`Response` instance::

   async def handler(request):
       return Response(text="All right!")

Response classes are :obj:`dict` like objects,
allowing them to be used for :ref:`sharing
data<aiohttp-web-data-sharing>` among :ref:`aiohttp-web-middlewares`
and :ref:`aiohttp-web-signals` handlers::

   resp['key'] = value

.. versionadded:: 3.0

   Dict-like interface support.

StreamResponse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: StreamResponse(*, status=200, reason=None)

   The base class for the *HTTP response* handling.

   Contains methods for setting *HTTP response headers*, *cookies*,
   *response status code*, writing *HTTP response BODY* and so on.

   The most important thing you should know about *response* --- it
   is *Finite State Machine*.

   That means you can do any manipulations with *headers*, *cookies*
   and *status code* only before :meth:`prepare` coroutine is called.

   Once you call :meth:`prepare` any change of
   the *HTTP header* part will raise :exc:`RuntimeError` exception.

   Any :meth:`write` call after :meth:`write_eof` is also forbidden.

   :param int status: HTTP status code, ``200`` by default.

   :param str reason: HTTP reason. If param is ``None`` reason will be
                      calculated basing on *status*
                      parameter. Otherwise pass :class:`str` with
                      arbitrary *status* explanation..

   .. attribute:: prepared

      Read-only :class:`bool` property, ``True`` if :meth:`prepare` has
      been called, ``False`` otherwise.

   .. attribute:: task

      A task that serves HTTP request handling.

      May be useful for graceful shutdown of long-running requests
      (streaming, long polling or web-socket).

   .. attribute:: status

      Read-only property for *HTTP response status code*, :class:`int`.

      ``200`` (OK) by default.

   .. attribute:: reason

      Read-only property for *HTTP response reason*, :class:`str`.

   .. method:: set_status(status, reason=None)

      Set :attr:`status` and :attr:`reason`.

      *reason* value is auto calculated if not specified (``None``).

   .. attribute:: keep_alive

      Read-only property, copy of :attr:`aiohttp.web.BaseRequest.keep_alive` by default.

      Can be switched to ``False`` by :meth:`force_close` call.

   .. method:: force_close

      Disable :attr:`keep_alive` for connection. There are no ways to
      enable it back.

   .. attribute:: compression

      Read-only :class:`bool` property, ``True`` if compression is enabled.

      ``False`` by default.

      .. seealso:: :meth:`enable_compression`

   .. method:: enable_compression(force=None)

      Enable compression.

      When *force* is unset compression encoding is selected based on
      the request's *Accept-Encoding* header.

      *Accept-Encoding* is not checked if *force* is set to a
      :class:`ContentCoding`.

      .. seealso:: :attr:`compression`

   .. attribute:: chunked

      Read-only property, indicates if chunked encoding is on.

      Can be enabled by :meth:`enable_chunked_encoding` call.

      .. seealso:: :attr:`enable_chunked_encoding`

   .. method:: enable_chunked_encoding()

      Enables :attr:`chunked` encoding for response. There are no ways to
      disable it back. With enabled :attr:`chunked` encoding each :meth:`write`
      operation encoded in separate chunk.

      .. warning:: chunked encoding can be enabled for ``HTTP/1.1`` only.

                   Setting up both :attr:`content_length` and chunked
                   encoding is mutually exclusive.

      .. seealso:: :attr:`chunked`

   .. attribute:: headers

      :class:`~multidict.CIMultiDict` instance
      for *outgoing* *HTTP headers*.

   .. attribute:: cookies

      An instance of :class:`http.cookies.SimpleCookie` for *outgoing* cookies.

      .. warning::

         Direct setting up *Set-Cookie* header may be overwritten by
         explicit calls to cookie manipulation.

         We are encourage using of :attr:`cookies` and
         :meth:`set_cookie`, :meth:`del_cookie` for cookie
         manipulations.

   .. method:: set_cookie(name, value, *, path='/', expires=None, \
                          domain=None, max_age=None, \
                          secure=None, httponly=None, version=None, \
                          samesite=None)

      Convenient way for setting :attr:`cookies`, allows to specify
      some additional properties like *max_age* in a single call.

      :param str name: cookie name

      :param str value: cookie value (will be converted to
                        :class:`str` if value has another type).

      :param expires: expiration date (optional)

      :param str domain: cookie domain (optional)

      :param int max_age: defines the lifetime of the cookie, in
                          seconds.  The delta-seconds value is a
                          decimal non- negative integer.  After
                          delta-seconds seconds elapse, the client
                          should discard the cookie.  A value of zero
                          means the cookie should be discarded
                          immediately.  (optional)

      :param str path: specifies the subset of URLs to
                       which this cookie applies. (optional, ``'/'`` by default)

      :param bool secure: attribute (with no value) directs
                          the user agent to use only (unspecified)

                          The user agent (possibly under the user's
                          control) may determine what level of
                          security it considers appropriate for
                          "secure" cookies.  The *secure* should be

                          contents. (optional)

      :param bool httponly: ``True`` if the cookie HTTP only (optional)

      :param int version: a decimal integer, identifies to which

         against cross-site request forgery attacks.
         Generally the value should be one of: ``None``,
         ``Lax`` or ``Strict``. (optional)

            .. versionadded:: 3.7

      .. warning::

         In HTTP version 1.1, ``expires`` was deprecated and replaced with
         the easier-to-use ``max-age``, but Internet Explorer (IE6, IE7,
         and IE8) **does not** support ``max-age``.

   .. method:: del_cookie(name, *, path='/', domain=None)

      Deletes cookie.

      :param str name: cookie name

      :param str domain: optional cookie domain

      :param str path: optional cookie path, ``'/'`` by default

   .. attribute:: content_length

      *Content-Length* for outgoing response.

   .. attribute:: content_type

      *Content* part of *Content-Type* for outgoing response.

   .. attribute:: charset

      *Charset* aka *encoding* part of *Content-Type* for outgoing response.

      The value converted to lower-case on attribute assigning.

   .. attribute:: last_modified

      *Last-Modified* header for outgoing response.

      This property accepts raw :class:`str` values,
      :class:`datetime.datetime` objects, Unix timestamps specified
      as an :class:`int` or a :class:`float` object, and the
      value ``None`` to unset the header.

   .. attribute:: etag

      *ETag* header for outgoing response.

      This property accepts raw :class:`str` values, :class:`~aiohttp.ETag`
      objects and the value ``None`` to unset the header.

      In case of :class:`str` input, etag is considered as strong by default.

      **Do not** use double quotes ``"`` in the etag value,
      they will be added automatically.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8

   .. comethod:: prepare(request)

      :param aiohttp.web.Request request: HTTP request object, that the
                                          response answers.

      Send *HTTP header*. You should not change any header data after
      calling this method.

      The coroutine calls :attr:`~aiohttp.web.Application.on_response_prepare`
      signal handlers after default headers have been computed and directly
      before headers are sent.

   .. comethod:: write(data)

      Send byte-ish data as the part of *response BODY*::

          await resp.write(data)

      :meth:`prepare` must be invoked before the call.

      Raises :exc:`TypeError` if data is not :class:`bytes`,
      :class:`bytearray` or :class:`memoryview` instance.

      Raises :exc:`RuntimeError` if :meth:`prepare` has not been called.

      Raises :exc:`RuntimeError` if :meth:`write_eof` has been called.

   .. comethod:: write_eof()

      A :ref:`coroutine<coroutine>` *may* be called as a mark of the
      *HTTP response* processing finish.

      *Internal machinery* will call this method at the end of
      the request processing if needed.

      After :meth:`write_eof` call any manipulations with the *response*
      object are forbidden.


Response
^^^^^^^^

.. class:: Response(*, body=None, status=200, reason=None, text=None, \
                    headers=None, content_type=None, charset=None, \
                    zlib_executor_size=sentinel, zlib_executor=None)

   The most usable response class, inherited from :class:`StreamResponse`.

   Accepts *body* argument for setting the *HTTP response BODY*.

   The actual :attr:`body` sending happens in overridden
   :meth:`~StreamResponse.write_eof`.

   :param bytes body: response's BODY

   :param int status: HTTP status code, 200 OK by default.

   :param collections.abc.Mapping headers: HTTP headers that should be added to
                           response's ones.

   :param str text: response's BODY

   :param str content_type: response's content type. ``'text/plain'``
                       if *text* is passed also,
                       ``'application/octet-stream'`` otherwise.

   :param str charset: response's charset. ``'utf-8'`` if *text* is
                       passed also, ``None`` otherwise.

   :param int zlib_executor_size: length in bytes which will trigger zlib compression
                            of body to happen in an executor

      .. versionadded:: 3.5

   :param int zlib_executor: executor to use for zlib compression

      .. versionadded:: 3.5


   .. attribute:: body

      Read-write attribute for storing response's content aka BODY,
      :class:`bytes`.

      Setting :attr:`body` also recalculates
      :attr:`~StreamResponse.content_length` value.

      Assigning :class:`str` to :attr:`body` will make the :attr:`body`
      type of :class:`aiohttp.payload.StringPayload`, which tries to encode
      the given data based on *Content-Type* HTTP header, while defaulting
      to ``UTF-8``.

      Resetting :attr:`body` (assigning ``None``) sets
      :attr:`~StreamResponse.content_length` to ``None`` too, dropping
      *Content-Length* HTTP header.

   .. attribute:: text

      Read-write attribute for storing response's content, represented as
      string, :class:`str`.

      Setting :attr:`text` also recalculates
      :attr:`~StreamResponse.content_length` value and
      :attr:`~aiohttp.StreamResponse.body` value

      Resetting :attr:`text` (assigning ``None``) sets
      :attr:`~StreamResponse.content_length` to ``None`` too, dropping
      *Content-Length* HTTP header.


FileResponse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: FileResponse(*, path, chunk_size=256*1024, status=200, reason=None, headers=None)

   The response class used to send files, inherited from :class:`StreamResponse`.

   Supports the ``Content-Range`` and ``If-Range`` HTTP Headers in requests.

   The actual :attr:`body` sending happens in overridden :meth:`~StreamResponse.prepare`.

   :param path: Path to file. Accepts both :class:`str` and :class:`pathlib.Path`.
   :param int chunk_size: Chunk size in bytes which will be passed into
                          :meth:`io.RawIOBase.read` in the event that the
                          ``sendfile`` system call is not supported.

   :param int status: HTTP status code, ``200`` by default.

   :param str reason: HTTP reason. If param is ``None`` reason will be
                      calculated basing on *status*
                      parameter. Otherwise pass :class:`str` with
                      arbitrary *status* explanation..

   :param collections.abc.Mapping headers: HTTP headers that should be added to
                           response's ones. The ``Content-Type`` response header
                           will be overridden if provided.

WebSocketResponse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: WebSocketResponse(*, timeout=10.0, receive_timeout=None, \
                             autoclose=True, autoping=True, heartbeat=None, \
                             protocols=(), compress=True, max_msg_size=4194304)

   Class for handling server-side websockets, inherited from
   :class:`StreamResponse`.

   After starting (by :meth:`prepare` call) the response you
   cannot use :meth:`~StreamResponse.write` method but should to
   communicate with websocket client by :meth:`send_str`,
   :meth:`receive` and others.

   To enable back-pressure from slow websocket clients treat methods
   :meth:`ping()`, :meth:`pong()`, :meth:`send_str()`,
   :meth:`send_bytes()`, :meth:`send_json()` as coroutines.  By
   default write buffer size is set to 64k.

   :param bool autoping: Automatically send
                         :const:`~aiohttp.WSMsgType.PONG` on
                         :const:`~aiohttp.WSMsgType.PING`
                         message from client, and handle
                         :const:`~aiohttp.WSMsgType.PONG`
                         responses from client.
                         Note that server does not send
                         :const:`~aiohttp.WSMsgType.PING`
                         requests, you need to do this explicitly
                         using :meth:`ping` method.

   :param float heartbeat: Send `ping` message every `heartbeat`
                           seconds and wait `pong` response, close
                           connection if `pong` response is not
                           received. The timer is reset on any data reception.

   :param float receive_timeout: Timeout value for `receive`
                                 operations.  Default value is None
                                 (no timeout for receive operation)

   :param bool compress: Enable per-message deflate extension support.
                          False for disabled, default value is True.

   :param int max_msg_size: maximum size of read websocket message, 4
                            MB by default. To disable the size limit use ``0``.

      .. versionadded:: 3.3


   The class supports ``async for`` statement for iterating over
   incoming messages::

      ws = web.WebSocketResponse()
      await ws.prepare(request)

          async for msg in ws:
              print(msg.data)


   .. comethod:: prepare(request)

   .. method:: can_prepare(request)

      Performs checks for *request* data to figure out if websocket
      can be started on the request.

      If :meth:`can_prepare` call is success then :meth:`prepare` will
      success too.

      :param aiohttp.web.Request request: HTTP request object, that the
                                          response answers.

      :return: :class:`WebSocketReady` instance.

               :attr:`WebSocketReady.ok` is
               ``True`` on success, :attr:`WebSocketReady.protocol` is
               websocket subprotocol which is passed by client and
               accepted by server (one of *protocols* sequence from
               :class:`WebSocketResponse` ctor).
               :attr:`WebSocketReady.protocol` may be ``None`` if

WebSocketReady
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. class:: WebSocketReady

   A named tuple for returning result from
   :meth:`WebSocketResponse.can_prepare`.

   Has :class:`bool` check implemented, e.g.::

       if not await ws.can_prepare(...):
           cannot_start_websocket()

   .. attribute:: ok

      ``True`` if websocket connection can be established, ``False``
      otherwise.


   .. attribute:: protocol

      :class:`str` represented selected websocket sub-protocol.

   .. seealso:: :meth:`WebSocketResponse.can_prepare`


json_response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: json_response([data], *, text=None, body=None, \

                            dumps=json.dumps)

Return :class:`Response` with predefined ``'application/json'``
content type and *data* encoded by ``dumps`` parameter
(:func:`json.dumps` by default).


.. _aiohttp-web-app-and-router:

Application and Router
----------------------


Application
^^^^^^^^^^^

Application is a synonym for web-server.

To get fully working example, you have to make *application*, register
supported urls in *router* and pass it to :func:`aiohttp.web.run_app`
or :class:`aiohttp.web.AppRunner`.

*Application* contains a *router* instance and a list of callbacks that
will be called during application finishing.

:class:`Application` is a :obj:`dict`-like object, so you can use it for
:ref:`sharing data<aiohttp-web-data-sharing>` globally by storing arbitrary
properties for later access from a :ref:`handler<aiohttp-web-handler>` via the
:attr:`Request.app` property::

   app = Application()
   app['database'] = await aiopg.create_engine(**db_config)

   async def handler(request):
       with (await request.app['database']) as conn:
           conn.execute("DELETE * FROM table")

Although :class:`Application` is a :obj:`dict`-like object, it can't be
duplicated like one using :meth:`~aiohttp.web.Application.copy`.

.. class:: Application(*, logger=<default>, middlewares=(), \
                       handler_args=None, client_max_size=1024**2, \
                       debug=...)

   The class inherits :class:`dict`.

   :param logger: :class:`logging.Logger` instance for storing application logs.

                  By default the value is ``logging.getLogger("aiohttp.web")``

   :param middlewares: :class:`list` of middleware factories, see
                       :ref:`aiohttp-web-middlewares` for details.

   :param handler_args: dict-like object that overrides keyword arguments of
                        :class:`AppRunner` constructor.

   :param client_max_size: client's maximum size in a request, in
                           bytes.  If a POST request exceeds this
                           value, it raises an
                           `HTTPRequestEntityTooLarge` exception.

   :param debug: Switches debug mode.

      .. deprecated:: 3.5

         The argument does nothing starting from 4.0,
         use asyncio :ref:`asyncio-debug-mode` instead.


   .. attribute:: router

      Read-only property that returns *router instance*.

   .. attribute:: logger

      :class:`logging.Logger` instance for storing application logs.

   .. attribute:: debug

      Boolean value indicating whether the debug mode is turned on or off.

      .. deprecated:: 3.5

         Use asyncio :ref:`asyncio-debug-mode` instead.

   .. attribute:: on_response_prepare

      A :class:`~aiohttp.Signal` that is fired near the end
      of :meth:`StreamResponse.prepare` with parameters *request* and
      *response*. It can be used, for example, to add custom headers to each
      response, or to modify the default headers computed by the application,
      directly before sending the headers to the client.

      Signal handlers should have the following signature::

          async def on_prepare(request, response):
              pass

   .. attribute:: on_startup

      A :class:`~aiohttp.Signal` that is fired on application start-up.

      Subscribers may use the signal to run background tasks in the event
      loop along with the application's request handler just after the
      application start-up.

      Signal handlers should have the following signature::

          async def on_startup(app):
              pass

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-signals` and :ref:`aiohttp-web-cleanup-ctx`.

   .. attribute:: on_shutdown

      A :class:`~aiohttp.Signal` that is fired on application shutdown.

      Subscribers may use the signal for gracefully closing long running
      connections, e.g. websockets and data streaming.

      Signal handlers should have the following signature::

          async def on_shutdown(app):
              pass

      It's up to end user to figure out which :term:`web-handler`\s
      are still alive and how to finish them properly.

      We suggest keeping a list of long running handlers in
      :class:`Application` dictionary.

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-graceful-shutdown` and :attr:`on_cleanup`.

   .. attribute:: on_cleanup

      A :class:`~aiohttp.Signal` that is fired on application cleanup.

      Subscribers may use the signal for gracefully closing
      connections to database server etc.

      Signal handlers should have the following signature::

          async def on_cleanup(app):
              pass

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-signals` and :attr:`on_shutdown`.

   .. attribute:: cleanup_ctx

      A list of *context generators* for *startup*/*cleanup* handling.

      Signal handlers should have the following signature::

          async def context(app):
              # do startup stuff
              yield
              # do cleanup

      .. versionadded:: 3.1

      .. seealso:: :ref:`aiohttp-web-cleanup-ctx`.

   .. method:: add_subapp(prefix, subapp)

      Register nested sub-application under given path *prefix*.

      In resolving process if request's path starts with *prefix* then
      further resolving is passed to *subapp*.

      :param str prefix: path's prefix for the resource.

      :param Application subapp: nested application attached under *prefix*.

      :returns: a :class:`PrefixedSubAppResource` instance.

   .. method:: add_domain(domain, subapp)

      Register nested sub-application that serves
      the domain name or domain name mask.

      In resolving process if request.headers['host']
      matches the pattern *domain* then
      further resolving is passed to *subapp*.

      :param str domain: domain or mask of domain for the resource.

      :param Application subapp: nested application.

      :returns: a :class:`~aiohttp.web.MatchedSubAppResource` instance.

   .. method:: add_routes(routes_table)

      Register route definitions from *routes_table*.

      The table is a :class:`list` of :class:`RouteDef` items or
      :class:`RouteTableDef`.

      :returns: :class:`list` of registered :class:`AbstractRoute` instances.

      The method is a shortcut for
      ``app.router.add_routes(routes_table)``, see also
      :meth:`UrlDispatcher.add_routes`.

      .. versionadded:: 3.1

      .. versionchanged:: 3.7

         Return value updated from ``None`` to :class:`list` of
         :class:`AbstractRoute` instances.

   .. comethod:: startup()

      A :ref:`coroutine<coroutine>` that will be called along with the
      application's request handler.

      The purpose of the method is calling :attr:`on_startup` signal
      handlers.

   .. comethod:: shutdown()

      A :ref:`coroutine<coroutine>` that should be called on
      server stopping but before :meth:`cleanup()`.

      The purpose of the method is calling :attr:`on_shutdown` signal
      handlers.

   .. comethod:: cleanup()

      A :ref:`coroutine<coroutine>` that should be called on
      server stopping but after :meth:`shutdown`.

      The purpose of the method is calling :attr:`on_cleanup` signal
      handlers.

   .. note::

      Application object has :attr:`router` attribute but has no
      ``add_route()`` method. The reason is: we want to support
      different router implementations (even maybe not url-matching
      based but traversal ones).

      For sake of that fact we have very trivial ABC for
      :class:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractRouter`: it should have only
      :meth:`aiohttp.abc.AbstractRouter.resolve` coroutine.

      No methods for adding routes or route reversing (getting URL by
      route name). All those are router implementation details (but,
      sure, you need to deal with that methods after choosing the
      router for your application).


Server
^^^^^^

A protocol factory compatible with
:meth:`~asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.create_server`.

.. class:: Server

   The class is responsible for creating HTTP protocol
   objects that can handle HTTP connections.

   .. attribute:: connections

      List of all currently opened connections.

   .. attribute:: requests_count

      Amount of processed requests.

   .. comethod:: Server.shutdown(timeout)

      A :ref:`coroutine<coroutine>` that should be called to close all opened
      connections.


Router
^^^^^^

For dispatching URLs to :ref:`handlers<aiohttp-web-handler>`
:mod:`aiohttp.web` uses *routers*.

Router is any object that implements :class:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractRouter` interface.

:mod:`aiohttp.web` provides an implementation called :class:`UrlDispatcher`.

:class:`Application` uses :class:`UrlDispatcher` as :meth:`~aiohttp.web.Application.router` by default.

.. class:: UrlDispatcher()

   Straightforward url-matching router, implements
   :class:`collections.abc.Mapping` for access to *named routes*.

   Before running :class:`Application` you should fill *route
   table* first by calling :meth:`add_route` and :meth:`add_static`.

   :ref:`Handler<aiohttp-web-handler>` lookup is performed by iterating on
   added *routes* in FIFO order. The first matching *route* will be used
   to call corresponding *handler*.

   If on route creation you specify *name* parameter the result is
   *named route*.

   *Named route* can be retrieved by ``app.router[name]`` call, checked for
   existence by ``name in app.router`` etc.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`Route classes <aiohttp-web-route>`

   .. method:: add_resource(path, *, name=None)

      Append a :term:`resource` to the end of route table.

      *path* may be either *constant* string like ``'/a/b/c'`` or
      *variable rule* like ``'/a/{var}'`` (see
      :ref:`handling variable paths <aiohttp-web-variable-handler>`)

      :param str path: resource path spec.

      :param str name: optional resource name.

      :return: created resource instance (:class:`PlainResource` or
               :class:`DynamicResource`).

   .. method:: add_route(method, path, handler, *, \
                         name=None, expect_handler=None)

      Append :ref:`handler<aiohttp-web-handler>` to the end of route table.

      *path* may be either *constant* string like ``'/a/b/c'`` or
       *variable rule* like ``'/a/{var}'`` (see
       :ref:`handling variable paths <aiohttp-web-variable-handler>`)

      Pay attention please: *handler* must be a coroutine.

      :param str method: HTTP method for route. Should be one of
                         ``'GET'``, ``'POST'``, ``'PUT'``,
                         ``'DELETE'``, ``'PATCH'``, ``'HEAD'``,
                         ``'OPTIONS'`` or ``'*'`` for any method.

                         The parameter is case-insensitive, e.g. you
                         can push ``'get'`` as well as ``'GET'``.

      :param str path: route path. Should be started with slash (``'/'``).

      :param collections.abc.Callable handler: route handler.

      :param str name: optional route name.

      :param collections.abc.Coroutine expect_handler: optional *expect* header handler.

      :returns: new :class:`AbstractRoute` instance.

   .. method:: add_routes(routes_table)

      Register route definitions from *routes_table*.

      The table is a :class:`list` of :class:`RouteDef` items or
      :class:`RouteTableDef`.

      :returns: :class:`list` of registered :class:`AbstractRoute` instances.

      .. versionadded:: 2.3

      .. versionchanged:: 3.7

         Return value updated from ``None`` to :class:`list` of
         :class:`AbstractRoute` instances.

   .. method:: add_get(path, handler, *, name=None, allow_head=True, **kwargs)

      Shortcut for adding a GET handler. Calls the :meth:`add_route` with \
      ``method`` equals to ``'GET'``.

      If *allow_head* is ``True`` (default) the route for method HEAD
      is added with the same handler as for GET.

      If *name* is provided the name for HEAD route is suffixed with
      ``'-head'``. For example ``router.add_get(path, handler,
      name='route')`` call adds two routes: first for GET with name
      ``'route'`` and second for HEAD with name ``'route-head'``.

   .. method:: add_post(path, handler, **kwargs)

      Shortcut for adding a POST handler. Calls the :meth:`add_route` with \


      ``method`` equals to ``'POST'``.

      ``method`` equals to ``'DELETE'``.

   .. method:: add_view(path, handler, **kwargs)

      Shortcut for adding a class-based view handler. Calls the \
      :meth:`add_route` with ``method`` equals to ``'*'``.

      .. versionadded:: 3.0

   .. method:: add_static(prefix, path, *, name=None, expect_handler=None, \
                          chunk_size=256*1024, \
                          response_factory=StreamResponse, \
                          show_index=False, \
                          follow_symlinks=False, \
                          append_version=False)

      Adds a router and a handler for returning static files.

      Useful for serving static content like images, javascript and css files.

      On platforms that support it, the handler will transfer files more
      efficiently using the ``sendfile`` system call.

      In some situations it might be necessary to avoid using the ``sendfile``
      system call even if the platform supports it. This can be accomplished by
      by setting environment variable ``AIOHTTP_NOSENDFILE=1``.

      If a gzip version of the static content exists at file path + ``.gz``, it
      will be used for the response.

      .. warning::

         Use :meth:`add_static` for development only. In production,
         static content should be processed by web servers like *nginx*
         or *apache*.

      :param str prefix: URL path prefix for handled static files

      :param path: path to the folder in file system that contains
                   handled static files, :class:`str` or :class:`pathlib.Path`.

      :param str name: optional route name.

      :param collections.abc.Coroutine expect_handler: optional *expect* header handler.

      :param int chunk_size: size of single chunk for file
                             downloading, 256Kb by default.

                             Increasing *chunk_size* parameter to,
                             say, 1Mb may increase file downloading
                             speed but consumes more memory.

      :param bool show_index: flag for allowing to show indexes of a directory,
                              by default it's not allowed and HTTP/403 will
                              be returned on directory access.

      :param bool follow_symlinks: flag for allowing to follow symlinks from
                              a directory, by default it's not allowed and
                              HTTP/404 will be returned on access.

      :param bool append_version: flag for adding file version (hash)
                              to the url query string, this value will
                              be used as default when you call to
                              :meth:`~aiohttp.web.AbstractRoute.url` and
                              :meth:`~aiohttp.web.AbstractRoute.url_for` methods.


      :returns: new :class:`~aiohttp.web.AbstractRoute` instance.

   .. comethod:: resolve(request)

      A :ref:`coroutine<coroutine>` that returns
      :class:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo` for *request*.

      The method never raises exception, but returns
      :class:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo` instance with:

      1. :attr:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo.http_exception` assigned to
         :exc:`HTTPException` instance.
      2. :meth:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo.handler` which raises
         :exc:`HTTPNotFound` or :exc:`HTTPMethodNotAllowed` on handler's
         execution if there is no registered route for *request*.

         *Middlewares* can process that exceptions to render
         pretty-looking error page for example.

      Used by internal machinery, end user unlikely need to call the method.

      .. note:: The method uses :attr:`aiohttp.web.BaseRequest.raw_path` for pattern
         matching against registered routes.

   .. method:: resources()

      The method returns a *view* for *all* registered resources.

      The view is an object that allows to:

      1. Get size of the router table::

           len(app.router.resources())

      2. Iterate over registered resources::

           for resource in app.router.resources():
               print(resource)

      3. Make a check if the resources is registered in the router table::

           route in app.router.resources()

   .. method:: routes()

      The method returns a *view* for *all* registered routes.

   .. method:: named_resources()

      Returns a :obj:`dict`-like :class:`types.MappingProxyType` *view* over
      *all* named **resources**.

      The view maps every named resource's **name** to the
      :class:`AbstractResource` instance. It supports the usual
      :obj:`dict`-like operations, except for any mutable operations
      (i.e. it's **read-only**)::

          len(app.router.named_resources())

          for name, resource in app.router.named_resources().items():
              print(name, resource)

          "name" in app.router.named_resources()

          app.router.named_resources()["name"]


.. _aiohttp-web-resource:

Resource
^^^^^^^^

Default router :class:`UrlDispatcher` operates with :term:`resource`\s.

Resource is an item in *routing table* which has a *path*, an optional
unique *name* and at least one :term:`route`.

:term:`web-handler` lookup is performed in the following way:

1. Router iterates over *resources* one-by-one.
2. If *resource* matches to requested URL the resource iterates over
   own *routes*.
3. If route matches to requested HTTP method (or ``'*'`` wildcard) the
   route's handler is used as found :term:`web-handler`. The lookup is
   finished.
4. Otherwise router tries next resource from the *routing table*.
5. If the end of *routing table* is reached and no *resource* /
   *route* pair found the *router* returns special :class:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo`
   instance with :attr:`aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo.http_exception` is not ``None``
   but :exc:`HTTPException` with  either *HTTP 404 Not Found* or
   *HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed* status code.
   Registered :meth:`~aiohttp.abc.AbstractMatchInfo.handler` raises this exception on call.

User should never instantiate resource classes but give it by
:meth:`UrlDispatcher.add_resource` call.

After that he may add a :term:`route` by calling :meth:`Resource.add_route`.

:meth:`UrlDispatcher.add_route` is just shortcut for::

   router.add_resource(path).add_route(method, handler)

Resource with a *name* is called *named resource*.
The main purpose of *named resource* is constructing URL by route name for
passing it into *template engine* for example::

   url = app.router['resource_name'].url_for().with_query({'a': 1, 'b': 2})

   .. method:: url_for(**params)

      Returns a :class:`~yarl.URL` for the resource.

      :param params: -- a variable substitutions for dynamic resource.

   The view raises *405 Method Not allowed*
   (:class:`HTTPMethodNotAllowed`) if requested web verb is not
   supported.

   :param request: instance of :class:`Request` that has initiated a view
                   processing.

   A utility function for running an application, serving it until
   keyboard interrupt and performing a
   :ref:`aiohttp-web-graceful-shutdown`.

   Suitable as handy tool for scaffolding aiohttp based projects.
   Perhaps production config will use more sophisticated runner but it
   good enough at least at very beginning stage.

   The server will listen on any host or Unix domain socket path you supply.
   If no hosts or paths are supplied, or only a port is supplied, a TCP server
   listening on 0.0.0.0 (all hosts) will be launched.

   Distributing HTTP traffic to multiple hosts or paths on the same
   application process provides no performance benefit as the requests are
   handled on the same event loop. See :doc:`deployment` for ways of
   distributing work for increased performance.

   :param app: :class:`Application` instance to run or a *coroutine*
               that returns an application.

   :param bool debug: enable :ref:`asyncio debug mode <asyncio-debug-mode>` if ``True``.

   :param str host: TCP/IP host or a sequence of hosts for HTTP server.
                    Default is ``'0.0.0.0'`` if *port* has been specified
                    or if *path* is not supplied.

   :param int port: TCP/IP port for HTTP server. Default is ``8080`` for plain
                    text HTTP and ``8443`` for HTTP via SSL (when
                    *ssl_context* parameter is specified).

   :param str path: file system path for HTTP server Unix domain socket.
                    A sequence of file system paths can be used to bind
                    multiple domain sockets. Listening on Unix domain
                    sockets is not supported by all operating systems.

   :param socket.socket sock: a preexisting socket object to accept connections on.
                       A sequence of socket objects can be passed.

   :param int shutdown_timeout: a delay to wait for graceful server
                                shutdown before disconnecting all
                                open client sockets hard way.

                                A system with properly
                                :ref:`aiohttp-web-graceful-shutdown`
                                implemented never waits for this
                                timeout but closes a server in a few
                                milliseconds.

   :param float keepalive_timeout: a delay before a TCP connection is
                                   closed after a HTTP request. The delay
                                   allows for reuse of a TCP connection.

      .. versionadded:: 3.8

   :param ssl_context: :class:`ssl.SSLContext` for HTTPS server,
                       ``None`` for HTTP connection.

   :param print: a callable compatible with :func:`print`. May be used
                 to override STDOUT output or suppress it. Passing `None`
                 disables output.

   :param int backlog: the number of unaccepted connections that the
                       system will allow before refusing new
                       connections (``128`` by default).

   :param access_log_class: class for `access_logger`. Default:
                            :data:`aiohttp.helpers.AccessLogger`.
                            Must to be a subclass of :class:`aiohttp.abc.AbstractAccessLogger`.

   :param access_log: :class:`logging.Logger` instance used for saving
                      access logs. Use ``None`` for disabling logs for
                      sake of speedup.

   :param access_log_format: access log format, see
                             :ref:`aiohttp-logging-access-log-format-spec`
                             for details.

   :param bool handle_signals: override signal TERM handling to gracefully
                               exit the application.

   :param bool reuse_address: tells the kernel to reuse a local socket in
                              TIME_WAIT state, without waiting for its
                              natural timeout to expire. If not specified
                              will automatically be set to True on UNIX.

   :param bool reuse_port: tells the kernel to allow this endpoint to be
                           bound to the same port as other existing
                           endpoints are bound to, so long as they all set
                           this flag when being created. This option is not
                           supported on Windows.

Normalize path middleware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: normalize_path_middleware(*, \
                                        append_slash=True, \
                                        remove_slash=False, \
                                        merge_slashes=True, \
                                        redirect_class=HTTPPermanentRedirect)

   Middleware factory which produces a middleware that normalizes
   the path of a request. By normalizing it means:

     - Add or remove a trailing slash to the path.
     - Double slashes are replaced by one.

   The middleware returns as soon as it finds a path that resolves
   correctly. The order if both merge and append/remove are enabled is:

     1. *merge_slashes*
     2. *append_slash* or *remove_slash*
     3. both *merge_slashes* and *append_slash* or *remove_slash*

   If the path resolves with at least one of those conditions, it will
   redirect to the new path.

   Only one of *append_slash* and *remove_slash* can be enabled. If both are
   ``True`` the factory will raise an ``AssertionError``

   If *append_slash* is ``True`` the middleware will append a slash when
   needed. If a resource is defined with trailing slash and the request
   comes without it, it will append it automatically.

   If *remove_slash* is ``True``, *append_slash* must be ``False``. When enabled
   the middleware will remove trailing slashes and redirect if the resource is
   defined.

   If *merge_slashes* is ``True``, merge multiple consecutive slashes in the
   path into one.

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

      Support for *remove_slash*
