Restore :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver` to be the default resolver. -- by :user:`bdraco`.

:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver` was disabled by default because
of IPv6 compatibility issues. These issues have been resolved and
:py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver` is again now the default resolver.
