Improved SSL connection handling by changing the default ``ssl_shutdown_timeout`` from ``0.1`` to ``0`` seconds. SSL connections now use Python's default graceful shutdown during normal operation but are aborted immediately when the connector is closed, providing optimal behavior for both cases. Also added support for ``ssl_shutdown_timeout=0`` on all Python versions. Previously, this value was rejected on Python 3.11+ and ignored on earlier versions. Non-zero values on Python < 3.11 now trigger a ``RuntimeWarning`` -- by :user:`bdraco`.
