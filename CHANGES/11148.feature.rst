Improved SSL connection handling by changing the default ``ssl_shutdown_timeout``
from ``0.1`` to ``0`` seconds. SSL connections now use Python's default graceful
shutdown during normal operation but are aborted immediately when the connector
is closed, providing optimal behavior for both cases. Also added support for
``ssl_shutdown_timeout=0`` on all Python versions. Previously, this value was
rejected on Python 3.11+ and ignored on earlier versions. Non-zero values on
Python < 3.11 now trigger a ``RuntimeWarning`` -- by :user:`bdraco`.

The ``ssl_shutdown_timeout`` parameter is now deprecated and will be removed in
aiohttp 4.0 as there is no clear use case for changing the default.
