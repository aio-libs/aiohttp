Changed the default ``ssl_shutdown_timeout`` from ``0.1`` to ``0`` seconds, and added support for ``ssl_shutdown_timeout=0`` on all Python versions. When the connector is closed, SSL connections are now aborted immediately by default instead of performing a graceful shutdown. Previously, ``ssl_shutdown_timeout=0`` was rejected on Python 3.11+ and ignored on earlier versions. Non-zero values on Python < 3.11 now trigger a ``RuntimeWarning`` -- by :user:`bdraco`.
