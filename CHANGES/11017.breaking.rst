Made ``ClientRequest.body`` setter and ``update_*`` methods protected -- by :user:`bdraco`.

The ``body`` setter on ``ClientRequest`` has been removed, and all ``update_*`` methods
(except ``update_body`` and ``update_proxy``) have been made protected by adding a leading underscore.

These methods were never documented and were not intended to be part of the public API.
They only recently became reachable in client middleware (introduced in 3.12.0), but
this was not intentional. Direct assignment to ``request.body`` could cause resource
leaks when the previous body contained file handles or other resources requiring cleanup.

Users should use the public ``update_body()`` async method instead, which properly
handles resource cleanup:

.. code-block:: python

   # Wrong - DO NOT use direct assignment
   request.body = new_data  # This no longer works

   # Correct - use update_body()
   await request.update_body(new_data)

Since client middleware was only introduced in version 3.12.0 this week, it was an
explicit choice to not increment the major version number for this change, as it prevents
resource leaks and enforces the intended API boundaries.
