Added client middleware support -- by :user:`bdraco` and :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.

This change allows users to add middleware to the client session and requests, enabling features like
authentication, logging, and request/response modification without modifying the core
request logic. Additionally, the :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientRequest.session` attribute was added,
allowing middleware to access the parent session for making additional requests.
