Fixed the type annotations on :meth:`MultipartWriter.append`,
:meth:`MultipartWriter.append_json` and
:meth:`MultipartWriter.append_form` -- by :user:`cakemanny`

Type checkers, such as mypy and Pyright, now no longer give type
errors when calling :py:meth:`MultipartWriter.append` with a plain
python dictionary as the headers argument.
