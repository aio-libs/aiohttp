The changelog categorization was made clearer. The
contributors can now mark their fragment files more
accurately -- by :user:`webknjaz`.

The new category tags are:

    * ``bugfix``

    * ``feature``

    * ``deprecation``

    * ``breaking`` (previously, ``removal``)

    * ``doc``

    * ``packaging``

    * ``contrib``

    * ``misc``
