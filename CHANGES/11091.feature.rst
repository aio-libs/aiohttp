Added ``ssl_shutdown_timeout`` parameter to :py:class:`~aiohttp.ClientSession` and :py:class:`~aiohttp.TCPConnector` to control the grace period for SSL shutdown handshake on TLS connections. This helps prevent "connection reset" errors on the server side while avoiding excessive delays during connector cleanup. Note: This parameter only takes effect on Python 3.11+ -- by :user:`bdraco`.
