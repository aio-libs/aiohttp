Fixed ``IOBasePayload`` and ``TextIOPayload`` reading entire files into memory when streaming large files -- by :user:`bdraco`.

When using file-like objects with the aiohttp client, the entire file would be read into memory if the file size was provided in the ``Content-Length`` header. This could cause out-of-memory errors when uploading large files. The payload classes now correctly read data in chunks of ``READ_SIZE`` (64KB) regardless of the total content length.
