Removed blocking I/O in the event loop for static resources and refactored
exception handling -- by :user:`steverep`.

File system calls when handling requests for static routs were moved to a
separate thread in order to potentially improve performance. Exception handling
was tightened in order to only return 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found responses
for expected scenarios; 500 Internal Server Error would be returned for any
unknown errors.
