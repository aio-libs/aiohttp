Fixed server response headers for ``Content-Type`` and ``Content-Encoding`` for
static compressed files -- by :user:`steverep`.

Server will now respond with a ``Content-Type`` appropriate for the compressed
file (e.g. ``"application/gzip"``), and omit the ``Content-Encoding`` header.
Users should expect that most clients will no longer decompress such responses
by default.
