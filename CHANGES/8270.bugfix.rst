Fix AsyncResolver to match ThreadedResolver behavior
-- by :user:`bdraco`.

On system with IPv6 support, the AsyncResolver would not fallback
to providing A records when AAAA records were not available.
Additionally, unlikely the ThreadedResolver, the AsyncResolver
did not handle link-local addresses correctly.

This change makes the behavior consistent with the ThreadedResolver.
