Fixed ``AsyncResolver`` to match ``ThreadedResolver`` behavior
-- by :user:`bdraco`.

On system with IPv6 support, the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver` would not fallback
to providing A records when AAAA records were not available.
Additionally, unlike the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`, the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver`
did not handle link-local addresses correctly.

This change makes the behavior consistent with the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`.
