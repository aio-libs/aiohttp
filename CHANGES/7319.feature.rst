Replaced ``WSMessage`` with ``WSMessageType``, which is now a tagged union of
``NamedTuple``s -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.

This change allows type checkers to know the precise type of ``data``
after checking the ``type`` attribute.

If accessing messages by tuple indexes, the order has now changed.
Code such as:
``typ, data, extra = ws_message``
will need to be changed to:
``data, extra, typ = ws_message``

No changes are needed if accessing by attribute name.
