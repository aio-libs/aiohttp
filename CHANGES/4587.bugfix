Always make sure transport is not closing before reuse a connection.

Reuse a protocol based on keepalive in headers is unreliable.
For example, uWSGI will not support keepalive even it serves a
http1.1 request, except explicitly configure uWSGI with a
`--http-keepalive` option.

Servers designed like uWSGI could cause aiohttp intermittently
raise a ConnectionResetException when the protocol poll runs
out and some protocol is reused.
