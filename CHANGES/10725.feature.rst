Added a comprehensive HTTP Digest Authentication client middleware (DigestAuthMiddleware)
that implements RFC 7616. The middleware supports all standard hash algorithms
(MD5, SHA, SHA-256, SHA-512) with session variants, handles both 'auth' and
'auth-int' quality of protection options, and automatically manages the
authentication flow by intercepting 401 responses and retrying with proper
credentials -- by :user:`feus4177`, :user:`TimMenninger`, and :user:`bdraco`.
