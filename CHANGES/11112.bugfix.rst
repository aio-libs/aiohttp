Fixed cookie parsing to be more lenient when handling cookies with special characters
in names or values. Cookies with characters like ``{``, ``}``, and ``/`` in names are now
accepted instead of causing a :exc:`~http.cookies.CookieError` and 500 errors. Additionally,
cookies with mismatched quotes in values are now parsed correctly, and quoted cookie
values are now handled consistently whether or not they include special attributes
like ``Domain``. Also fixed :class:`~aiohttp.CookieJar` to ensure shared cookies (domain="", path="")
respect the ``quote_cookie`` parameter, making cookie quoting behavior consistent for
all cookies -- by :user:`bdraco`.
