Move file existence and type checks to ``FileResponse``,
and fix it to handle permission errors -- by :user:`steverep`.

The :py:class:`~aiohttp.web.FileResponse` class was modified to respond with
 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found as appropriate.  Previously, it would cause a
 server error if the path did not exist or could not be accessed.  Checks for
 existence, non-regular files, and permissions were expected to be done in the
 route handler.  For static routes, this now permits a compressed file to exist
 without its uncompressed variant and still be served.
