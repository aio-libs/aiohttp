The shutdown logic in 3.9 waited on all tasks, which caused issues with some libraries.
In 3.10 we've changed this logic to only wait on request handlers. This means that it's
important for developers to correctly handle the lifecycle of background tasks using a
library such as aiojobs_. If an application is using ``handler_cancellation=True`` then
it is also a good idea to ensure that any :func:`asyncio.shield` calls are replaced with
:func:`aiojobs.aiohttp.shield`.

Please read the updated documentation on these points:
