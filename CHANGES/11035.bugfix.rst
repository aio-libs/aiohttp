Fixed ``Content-Length`` header not being set to ``0`` for non-GET requests with ``None`` body -- by :user:`bdraco`.

Non-GET requests (``POST``, ``PUT``, ``PATCH``, ``DELETE``) with ``None`` as the body now correctly set the ``Content-Length`` header to ``0``, matching the behavior of requests with empty bytes (``b""``). This regression was introduced in aiohttp 3.12.1.
