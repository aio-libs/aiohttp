WSS: Fix heartbeat timeout logic -- by :user:`arcivanov`.

When a WebSocket pong message was not received, the
 :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` operation was not terminated.
 This change causes `_pong_not_received` to feed the `reader` an error message, causing
 pending `receive` to terminate and return the error message. The error message contains
 the exception :py:class:`~aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError`.
