Add support for using async context managers as cleanup contexts
---------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, application cleanup contexts required a single-yielding
async generator. This change allows cleanup context callbacks to return
contextlib.asynccontextmanager instances as well. The async context
manager is adapted internally so it behaves like a single-yield async
iterator: its ``__aenter__`` is executed at startup and ``__aexit__`` at
cleanup. Existing async generator-based cleanup contexts remain
supported.
