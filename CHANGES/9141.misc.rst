Modified the `ClientSession` class by adding a private attribute `_retry_connection` of type `bool`, with a default value of `True` to the class.
`retry_persistent_connection` in `ClientSession` is set to `False` if `_retry_connection` was `False`.
In the session of `TestClient`, `ClientSession` attribute `_retry_connection` is changed to `False` -- by :user:`ShubhAgarwal-dev`.
