3.3.0 (2018-06-01)
==================

Features
--------

- Raise ``ConnectionResetError`` instead of ``CancelledError`` on trying to
  write to a closed stream. (`#2499 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2499>`_)
- Implement ``ClientTimeout`` class and support socket read timeout. (`#2768 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2768>`_)
- Enable logging when ``aiohttp.web`` is used as a program (`#2956 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2956>`_)
- Add canonical property to resources (`#2968 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2968>`_)
- Forbid reading response BODY after release (`#2983 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2983>`_)
- Implement base protocol class to avoid a dependency from internal
  ``asyncio.streams.FlowControlMixin`` (`#2986 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2986>`_)
- Cythonize ``@helpers.reify``, 5% boost on macro benchmark (`#2995 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2995>`_)
- Optimize HTTP parser (`#3015 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3015>`_)
- Implement ``runner.addresses`` property. (`#3036 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3036>`_)
- Use ``bytearray`` instead of a list of ``bytes`` in websocket reader. It
  improves websocket message reading a little. (`#3039 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3039>`_)
- Remove heartbeat on closing connection on keepalive timeout. The used hack
  violates HTTP protocol. (`#3041 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3041>`_)
- Limit websocket message size on reading to 4 MB by default. (`#3045 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3045>`_)


Bugfixes
--------

- Don't reuse a connection with the same URL but different proxy/TLS settings
  (`#2981 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2981>`_)
- When parsing the Forwarded header, the optional port number is now preserved.
  (`#3009 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3009>`_)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Make Change Log more visible in docs (`#3029 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3029>`_)
- Make style and grammar improvements on the FAQ page. (`#3030 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3030>`_)
- Document that signal handlers should be async functions since aiohttp 3.0
  (`#3032 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3032>`_)
