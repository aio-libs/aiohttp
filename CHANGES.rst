3.7.4 (2021-02-25)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- **(SECURITY BUG)** Started preventing open redirects in the
  ``aiohttp.web.normalize_path_middleware`` middleware. For
  more details, see
  https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg.

  Thanks to `Beast Glatisant <https://github.com/g147>`__ for
  finding the first instance of this issue and `Jelmer VernooÄ³
  <https://jelmer.uk/>`__ for reporting and tracking it down
  in aiohttp.
  `#5497 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5497>`_
- Fix interpretation difference of the pure-Python and the Cython-based
  HTTP parsers construct a ``yarl.URL`` object for HTTP request-target.

  Before this fix, the Python parser would turn the URI's absolute-path
  for ``//some-path`` into ``/`` while the Cython code preserved it as
  ``//some-path``. Now, both do the latter.

  Reuse a protocol based on keepalive in headers is unreliable.
  For example, uWSGI will not support keepalive even it serves a

  raise a ConnectionResetException when the protocol poll runs
  out and some protocol is reused.

  increases CPU load as a side effect.

3.5.2 (2019-01-08)
==================

Features
--------

- ``FileResponse`` from ``web_fileresponse.py`` uses a ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` to work
  with files asynchronously.  I/O based payloads from ``payload.py`` uses a
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` to work with I/O objects asynchronously.  `#3313
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3313>`_
- Internal Server Errors in plain text if the browser does not support HTML.
  `#3483 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3483>`_


Bugfixes
--------

- Preserve MultipartWriter parts headers on write.  Refactor the way how
  ``Payload.headers`` are handled. Payload instances now always have headers and
  Content-Type defined.  Fix Payload Content-Disposition header reset after initial
  creation.  `#3035 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3035>`_
- Log suppressed exceptions in ``GunicornWebWorker``.
  `#3464 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3464>`_
- Remove wildcard imports.
  `#3468 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3468>`_
- Use the same task for app initialization and web server handling in gunicorn workers.
  It allows to use Python3.7 context vars smoothly.
  `#3471 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3471>`_
- Fix handling of chunked+gzipped response when first chunk does not give uncompressed
  data `#3477 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3477>`_
- Replace ``collections.MutableMapping`` with ``collections.abc.MutableMapping`` to
  avoid a deprecation warning.  `#3480
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3480>`_
- ``Payload.size`` type annotation changed from ``Optional[float]`` to
  ``Optional[int]``.  `#3484 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3484>`_
- Ignore done tasks when cancels pending activities on ``web.run_app`` finalization.
  `#3497 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3497>`_


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Add documentation for ``aiohttp.web.HTTPException``.
  `#3490 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3490>`_

3.5.1 (2018-12-24)
====================

- Fix a regression about ``ClientSession._requote_redirect_url`` modification in debug
  mode.

3.5.0 (2018-12-22)
====================

Features
--------

- The library type annotations are checked in strict mode now.
- Add support for setting cookies for individual request (`#2387
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2387>`_)
- Application.add_domain implementation (`#2809
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/2809>`_)
- The default ``app`` in the request returned by ``test_utils.make_mocked_request`` can
  now have objects assigned to it and retrieved using the ``[]`` operator. (`#3174
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3174>`_)
- Make ``request.url`` accessible when transport is closed. (`#3177
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3177>`_)
- Add ``zlib_executor_size`` argument to ``Response`` constructor to allow compression
  to run in a background executor to avoid blocking the main thread and potentially
  triggering health check failures. (`#3205
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3205>`_)
- Enable users to set ``ClientTimeout`` in ``aiohttp.request`` (`#3213
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3213>`_)
- Don't raise a warning if ``NETRC`` environment variable is not set and ``~/.netrc``
  file doesn't exist. (`#3267 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3267>`_)
- Add default logging handler to web.run_app If the ``Application.debug``` flag is set
  and the default logger ``aiohttp.access`` is used, access logs will now be output

  default logger has no log level set, the log level will be set to ``DEBUG``. (`#3324
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3324>`_)
- Add method argument to ``session.ws_connect()``.  Sometimes server API requires a
  different HTTP method for WebSocket connection establishment.  For example, ``Docker
  exec`` needs POST. (`#3378 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3378>`_)
- Create a task per request handling. (`#3406
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3406>`_)

  sub-applications. (`#3237 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3237>`_)

  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3265>`_)
- Fix forward compatibility with Python 3.8: importing ABCs directly from the
  collections module will not be supported anymore. (`#3273
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3273>`_)
- Keep the query string by ``normalize_path_middleware``. (`#3278
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3278>`_)

  (`#3361 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3361>`_)
- Release HTTP response before raising status exception (`#3364
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3364>`_)
- Fix task cancellation when ``sendfile()`` syscall is used by static file
  handling. (`#3383 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3383>`_)
- Fix stack trace for ``asyncio.TimeoutError`` which was not logged, when it is caught
  in the handler. (`#3414 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3414>`_)

- Encourage creation of aiohttp public objects inside a coroutine (`#3331
  <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3331>`_)
