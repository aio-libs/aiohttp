Bug fixes
---------

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8653`.



- Fixed :py:class:`aiohttp.TCPConnector` doing blocking I/O in the event loop to create the ``SSLContext`` -- by :user:`bdraco`.

  The blocking I/O would only happen once per verify mode. However, it could cause the event loop to block for a long time if the ``SSLContext`` creation is slow, which is more likely during startup when the disk cache is not yet present.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8672`.




Miscellaneous internal changes
------------------------------

- Improved performance of :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` and :py:meth:`~aiohttp.web.WebSocketResponse.receive` when there is no timeout. -- by :user:`bdraco`.

  The timeout context manager is now avoided when there is no timeout as it accounted for up to 50% of the time spent in the :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` and :py:meth:`~aiohttp.web.WebSocketResponse.receive` methods.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8632`.



- Fixed WebSocket ping tasks being prematurely garbage collected -- by :user:`bdraco`.

  There was a small risk that WebSocket ping tasks would be prematurely garbage collected because the event loop only holds a weak reference to the task. The garbage collection risk has been fixed by holding a strong reference to the task. Additionally, the task is now scheduled eagerly with Python 3.12+ to increase the chance it can be completed immediately and avoid having to hold any references to the task.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*

3.10.1 (2024-08-03)
========================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed WebSocket server heartbeat timeout logic to terminate :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` and return :py:class:`~aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError` -- by :user:`arcivanov`.

  When a WebSocket pong message was not received, the :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` operation did not terminate. This change causes ``_pong_not_received`` to feed the ``reader`` an error message, causing pending :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` to terminate and return the error message. The error message contains the exception :py:class:`~aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8540`.



- Fixed url dispatcher index not matching when a variable is preceded by a fixed string after a slash -- by :user:`bdraco`.

Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes
---------------------------------------------------

- Creating :py:class:`aiohttp.TCPConnector`, :py:class:`aiohttp.ClientSession`, :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver` :py:class:`aiohttp.web.Server`, or :py:class:`aiohttp.CookieJar` instances without a running event loop now raises a :exc:`RuntimeError` -- by :user:`asvetlov`.

  Creating these objects without a running event loop was deprecated in :issue:`3372` which was released in version 3.5.0.

  This change first appeared in version 3.10.0 as :issue:`6378`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8555`, :issue:`8583`.




----


3.10.0 (2024-07-30)
========================

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed server response headers for ``Content-Type`` and ``Content-Encoding`` for
  static compressed files -- by :user:`steverep`.

  Server will now respond with a ``Content-Type`` appropriate for the compressed
  file (e.g. ``"application/gzip"``), and omit the ``Content-Encoding`` header.
  Users should expect that most clients will no longer decompress such responses
  by default.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`4462`.



- Fixed duplicate cookie expiration calls in the CookieJar implementation


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`7784`.



- Adjusted ``FileResponse`` to check file existence and access when preparing the response -- by :user:`steverep`.

  The :py:class:`~aiohttp.web.FileResponse` class was modified to respond with
   403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found as appropriate.  Previously, it would cause a
   server error if the path did not exist or could not be accessed.  Checks for
   existence, non-regular files, and permissions were expected to be done in the
   route handler.  For static routes, this now permits a compressed file to exist
   without its uncompressed variant and still be served.  In addition, this
   changes the response status for files without read permission to 403, and for
   non-regular files from 404 to 403 for consistency.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8182`.



- Fixed ``AsyncResolver`` to match ``ThreadedResolver`` behavior
  -- by :user:`bdraco`.

  On system with IPv6 support, the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver` would not fallback
  to providing A records when AAAA records were not available.
  Additionally, unlike the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`, the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver`
  did not handle link-local addresses correctly.

  This change makes the behavior consistent with the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8270`.



- Fixed ``ws_connect`` not respecting `receive_timeout`` on WS(S) connection.
  -- by :user:`arcivanov`.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8444`.



- Removed blocking I/O in the event loop for static resources and refactored
  exception handling -- by :user:`steverep`.

  File system calls when handling requests for static routes were moved to a
  separate thread to potentially improve performance. Exception handling
  was tightened in order to only return 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found responses
  for expected scenarios; 500 Internal Server Error would be returned for any
  unknown errors.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`8507`.




Features
--------

- Added a Request.wait_for_disconnection() method, as means of allowing request handlers to be notified of premature client disconnections.


  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`2492`.



- Added 5 new exceptions: :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.RedirectClientError`,
  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlRedirectClientError`,
  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlRedirectClientError`

  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlRedirectClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlRedirectClientError`
  are raised instead of :py:exc:`ValueError` or :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidURL` when the redirect URL is invalid. Classes
  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.RedirectClientError`,
  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlClientError` are base for them.

  The :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidURL` now exposes a ``description`` property with the text explanation of the error details.

  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*
  :issue:`7297`.



- Implemented filter_cookies() with domain-matching and path-matching on the keys, instead of testing every single cookie.
  This may break existing cookies that have been saved with `CookieJar.save()`. Cookies can be migrated with this script::

      import pickle
      with file_path.open("rb") as f:
          cookies = pickle.load(f)

      morsels = [(name, m) for c in cookies.values() for name, m in c.items()]
      cookies.clear()
      for name, m in morsels:
          cookies[(m["domain"], m["path"].rstrip("/"))][name] = m

      with file_path.open("wb") as f:
          pickle.dump(cookies, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

Removals and backward incompatible breaking changes
---------------------------------------------------

- The shutdown logic in 3.9 waited on all tasks, which caused issues with some libraries.
  In 3.10 we've changed this logic to only wait on request handlers. This means that it's
  important for developers to correctly handle the lifecycle of background tasks using a
  library such as ``aiojobs``. If an application is using ``handler_cancellation=True`` then
  it is also a good idea to ensure that any :func:`asyncio.shield` calls are replaced with
  :func:`aiojobs.aiohttp.shield`.

  Please read the updated documentation on these points: \

- Disable implicit switch-back to pure python mode. The build fails loudly if aiohttp
  cannot be compiled with C Accelerators.  Use AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 to explicitly
  disable C Extensions complication and switch to Pure-Python mode.  Note that Pure-Python
  mode is significantly slower than compiled one.
  `#3828 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3828>`_
- Make access log use local time with timezone
  `#3853 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/3853>`_
- Implemented ``readuntil`` in ``StreamResponse``
  `#4054 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4054>`_
- FileResponse now supports ETag.
  `#4594 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4594>`_
- Add a request handler type alias ``aiohttp.typedefs.Handler``.
  `#4686 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4686>`_
- ``AioHTTPTestCase`` is more async friendly now.

  For people who use unittest and are used to use :py:exc:`~unittest.TestCase`
  it will be easier to write new test cases like the sync version of the :py:exc:`~unittest.TestCase` class,
  without using the decorator `@unittest_run_loop`, just `async def test_*`.
  The only difference is that for the people using python3.7 and below a new dependency is needed, it is ``asynctestcase``.
  `#4700 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4700>`_
- Add validation of HTTP header keys and values to prevent header injection.
  `#4818 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4818>`_

- Switch to external frozenlist and aiosignal libraries.
  `#5293 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5293>`_
- Don't send secure cookies by insecure transports.

  By default, the transport is secure if https or wss scheme is used.
  Use `CookieJar(treat_as_secure_origin="http://127.0.0.1")` to override the default security checker.
  `#5571 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5571>`_
- Always create a new event loop in ``aiohttp.web.run_app()``.
  This adds better compatibility with ``asyncio.run()`` or if trying to run multiple apps in sequence.
  `#5572 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5572>`_
- Add ``aiohttp.pytest_plugin.AiohttpClient`` for static typing of pytest plugin.
  `#5585 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5585>`_

3.7.4 (2021-02-25)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- **(SECURITY BUG)** Started preventing open redirects in the

  more details, see
  https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg.

  Thanks to `Beast Glatisant <https://github.com/g147>`__ for

  <https://jelmer.uk/>`__ for reporting and tracking it down
  in aiohttp.
  `#5497 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/5497>`_
- Fix interpretation difference of the pure-Python and the Cython-based
  HTTP parsers construct a ``yarl.URL`` object for HTTP request-target.

  Before this fix, the Python parser would turn the URI's absolute-path
  for ``//some-path`` into ``/`` while the Cython code preserved it as
  ``//some-path``. Now, both do the latter.

  `#4562 <https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/4562>`_
- Always make sure transport is not closing before reuse a connection.

  Reuse a protocol based on keepalive in headers is unreliable.
  For example, uWSGI will not support keepalive even it serves a
  HTTP 1.1 request, except explicitly configure uWSGI with a
  ``--http-keepalive`` option.

  Servers designed like uWSGI could cause aiohttp intermittently
  raise a ConnectionResetException when the protocol poll runs
  out and some protocol is reused.

----


3.1.0 (2018-03-21)
==================

Welcome to aiohttp 3.1 release.

This is an *incremental* release, fully backward compatible with *aiohttp 3.0*.

But we have added several new features.

The most visible one is ``app.add_routes()`` (an alias for existing
``app.router.add_routes()``. The addition is very important because
all *aiohttp* docs now uses ``app.add_routes()`` call in code
snippets. All your existing code still do register routes / resource
without any warning but you've got the idea for a favorite way: noisy
``app.router.add_get()`` is replaced by ``app.add_routes()``.

The library does not make a preference between decorators::

   routes = web.RouteTableDef()

   @routes.get('/')
   async def hello(request):
       return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

   app.add_routes(routes)

and route tables as a list::

   async def hello(request):
       return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

   app.add_routes([web.get('/', hello)])

Both ways are equal, user may decide basing on own code taste.

Also we have a lot of minor features, bug fixes and documentation
updates, see below.
